# SpongeModule
## Introduction
Predicting competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) or microRNA (miRNA) sponge modules is a challenge and meaningful task in revealing ceRNA regulation mechanism at the module level. Modules upon this backdrop represent groups of miRNA sponges with mutual competition, which are prone to be functional units for achieving biological processes. The existing in silico methods of identifying miRNA sponge modules are categorized into three types: (i) network-based clustering, (ii) matrix factorization, and (iii) step-wise evaluation. 

## Five representative module discovery methods for comparison

-Network-based clustering:SC+MCL,SPONGE+MCL

-Matrix factorization:jointNMF, LAceModule

-Step-wise evaluation:LMSM
